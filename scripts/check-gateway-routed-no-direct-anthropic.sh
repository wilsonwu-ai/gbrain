# CI guard: fail if gateway-routed source files reintroduce direct Anthropic
# SDK instantiation (`new Anthropic()` / `import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk'`
# as a runtime constructor, NOT a type-only import).
#
# Why this exists: v0.35.5.0 migrated src/core/think/index.ts from `new Anthropic()`
# to a gateway.chat() adapter (closed #952). v0.41+ wave did the same for
# src/core/cycle/synthesize.ts (T5 in the community PR wave). Both files
# now route through src/core/ai/gateway.ts so any provider with a registered
# recipe (Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Voyage, Ollama, llama-server, ...)
# is reachable via `models.dream.synthesize_verdict` / chat model config.
#
# Without this guard, a future contributor adding `import Anthropic from
# '@anthropic-ai/sdk'` and `new Anthropic()` to either file silently re-opens
# the same provider-lock-in bug class. The symptom is "my DeepSeek config
# isn't being used by dream synthesize" — invisible until first user report.
#
# Mirrors the pattern of scripts/check-jsonb-pattern.sh.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-gateway-routed-no-direct-anthropic.sh
# Exit:  0 when clean, 1 when a guarded file imports the SDK as a runtime value.
